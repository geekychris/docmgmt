Create a springboot application that is a document management system.  This should be database backed.  The main entity / object is called SysObject.  This object can have subclasses that extend the object with new attributes.  The SysObject supports versioning, supporting a major, minor versioning scheme.  If a Sysobject is versioned it will initially inherit all the attribute values of its parent version.  This object can have a multiple Content objects.  A content object provides a way to store a bytestream of data.  The content object either stores the bytestream (content) in the database or can also store this content on disk.  If stored on disk the root of that disk location is defined in another object called "FileStore".  The content object would reference the filestore if it is storing the content on disk.  There maybe one or more filestores defined for a running system.  The SysObject as mentioned should support defining subclasses.  There should be a rest api that provides CRUD operations on sysobjects, content objects and filstore.  This should include a way to upload and download content.  When a system object is versioned not only should the attributes be copied but references to the content objects should be copied, but the content objects should be shared.  If the new sysobject version updates a content object the reference should be broken.  That is the parents copy of the content should remain the same.
